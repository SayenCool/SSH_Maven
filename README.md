# SSH_Maven
## Instrucion
SSH framework practice (CRUD).Two entities(CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE, CascadeType.DELETE).
## About DB
Just create database by yourself, on condition that when entities are defined properly, tables of the project will be **automatically created** as long as the server start.
JPA is also used.
